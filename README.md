# Syntax highlighting to colorize C# code using MS Word
There's no other way I have found for colorizing C# code into a PDF so I have created a macro you can run on any C# code you paste into a Word doc and it will colour code it for you.
It is only VBA, which is regarded as a dark art these days, so it does have limitations (like only a small set of colours available). It's not perfect but it does the job!
